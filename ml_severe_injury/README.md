# ML Severe Injury Analysis

This folder contains code, data, and documentation for machine learning analysis to detect severe injuries in MAUDE MDR text reports.

## Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA, NLP, and modeling
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for data processing and model training
- `data/` – Input data and processed datasets
- `models/` – Saved ML models
- `results/` – Output results, metrics, and visualizations
- `README.md` – This file

## Getting Started
1. Place raw MDR data in `data/`.
2. Use notebooks in `notebooks/` for exploration and prototyping.
3. Use scripts in `scripts/` for reproducible pipelines.
4. Save trained models in `models/` and results in `results/`.

## Goal
Develop and evaluate machine learning models to automatically identify reports describing severe injuries in the MAUDE database.
